# Clojure-Scala Cantrips

This document covers couple of tips and tricks on how to consume scala apis from a clojure codebase.

Clojure and scala, both being laguages that run on jvm, have a common denominator. That is java byte code. In order to use a scala library from clojure code we need to know two things;
  * How does a scala api manifest itselfs in java byte code
  * How to consume a java api from clojure code

The internals of scala to java translation can be uncovered by using the [javap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javap.html) tool. The knowledge about clojure - java interoperability is drawn from [its documentation](https://clojure.org/reference/java_interop). All of the examples shown in this document are put together based on these two resources.


#### Who is this document for?

This document covers the basic usecases of clojure - scala interoperability. People who want to learn about how the scala structures are represented in java and how the clojure code interacts with them would be interested.

#### Why?

This document is more for educational purposes rather than production usage. There are libraries out there that does a good job in providing the functionality covered here. This document is for understanding the underlying semantics of clojure - scala interoperability.


## Letâ€™s get started

#### Prerequisites

The source code of all of the examples below can be found in the [`src` directory](src). In order to see the java api of the scala structure you can run;
```make
make show-{{example-name}}
```

In order to execute the clojure code that consumes the scala api  you can run;
```make
make run-{{example-name}}
```

## Accessing the constructor

Instantiating regular scala classes is as straightforward as instantiating a java class. Given [this class](src/primary_constructor/scala.scala);
```scala
class TestClass(param1: Int, param2: String)
```

`make show-primary-constructor` generates the java code below ;
```java
public class TestClass {
  public TestClass(int, java.lang.String);
}
```

And the clojure code to instantiate this class looks like [this](src/primary_constructor/clojure.clj);
```clojure
(let [instance1 (new TestClass 1 "test")
      instance2 (TestClass. 1 "test")] ;the shorthand notation

      (println instance1)   ;TestClass@
      (println instance2))) ;TestClass@
```

## Accessing the n-ary constructors

Just same as in Java, having multiple constructor is also possible in Scala. Accessing these constructors is as straightforward as accessing the primary constructor. [The class below](src/n_ary_constructor/scala.scala);
```scala
class TestClass(val a: Int, val b: Int) {

  def this(a: Int) {
    this(a, 0);
  }

  def this() {
    this(0, 0);
  }

  def this(a: String) {
    this(a.toInt, a.toInt);
  }
}
```

Generates the java api below (`make show-nary-constructor`);
```java
public class clojure.scala.interop.nary.constructor.TestClass {
  public int a();
  public int b();
  public clojure.scala.interop.nary.constructor.TestClass(int, int);
  public clojure.scala.interop.nary.constructor.TestClass(int);
  public clojure.scala.interop.nary.constructor.TestClass();
  public clojure.scala.interop.nary.constructor.TestClass(java.lang.String);
}
```

Accessing these constructors are demonstrated [in this class](src/n_ary_constructor/clojure.clj);
```clojure
(let [instance1 (TestClass. 1 2)
    instance2 (TestClass. 2)
    instance3 (TestClass.)
    instance4 (TestClass. "4")]

    (println (.a instance1)) ; 1
    (println (.b instance1)) ; 2

    (println (.a instance2)) ; 2
    (println (.b instance2)) ; 0

    (println (.a instance3)) ; 0
    (println (.b instance3)) ; 0

    (println (.a instance4))   ; 4
    (println (.b instance4)))) ; 4
```
